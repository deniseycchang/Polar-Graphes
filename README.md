# Polar-Graphes

Sketch polar graphes using Python.

## Files
- `Polar_graph.py`: Sketch polar graphes.
- `polar.png`: The output, polar graphes.

## Tools
* Python: WebScraping, data type conversion.
* MatPlotLib: Visualization.

## Note
This is part of a Pre-Calculus exam I gave to my students. There were few polar equations and students have to match them to the right graphes.
