# Polar-Graphes

Sketch polar graphes using Python.

## Files
- `Polar_graph.py`: Sketch polar graphes.
- `polar.png`: The output, polar graphes.

## Tools
* Python: Sketching graphes.
* MatPlotLib: Visualization.

## Functions
(I) r = sin(3x)

(II) r = sin(4x)
(III) r = -2 * cos(x)
(IV) r = sin(x/2)
(V) r = 1+cos(x)
(VI) r = x

## Note
This is part of a Pre-Calculus exam I gave to my students. There were few polar equations and students have to match them to the right graphes.
